## Project Euler in JS

- You probably want to take look inside `src/problems` for the meat of whats going on.
- sticking the basics of functional programming to solve each one
  - Locked node version to `6.9.2` so that `--harmony` flags can be used for TCO so its important to use the scripts defined in `package.json`

- ``` yarn test ```
- ``` yarn start ``` to see the results of  any individual problem
